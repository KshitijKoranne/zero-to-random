What is *zero*?  

It’s the starting point — the blank page, the silent moment, the clean slate. It's the space where nothing has happened *yet*, but anything *could*. Zero is grounding. It reminds us of humility, potential, and the quiet before the storm.

What is *random*?  
It’s freedom — the unfiltered stream of ideas, tangents, thoughts, discoveries. It’s chaos, but it’s also creativity. Random is what happens when you stop forcing things into a mold and let curiosity drive.

### Why *Zero to Random*?

This blog isn’t about one topic. It’s about starting from nothing and letting the journey shape itself — one idea, one post, one rabbit hole at a time. No fixed niche, no rigid format. Just exploration.

*Zero to Random* is a mindset.  
It’s for makers, thinkers, learners, tinkerers, philosophers, and anyone who likes asking “What if?”

### Why this blog?

Because starting is hard. And having permission to go in any direction makes it easier.

You’ll find ideas here — from tech tools and productivity to deep thoughts, side projects, things I’ve learned, and things I’m still unlearning. Each post will build on a sense of curiosity rather than a plan.

This is not a destination.  
This is a logbook of randomness, starting from zero.

Let’s begin.
